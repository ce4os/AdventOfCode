# Awesome! AdventOfCode - Solutions in Python

These are my solutions for some of the puzzles provided by 
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) (be sure to check it out!)
The primary reason for solving the puzzles is simply the pure joy of doing so.
The other reason is to challenge myself and get better at coding. 

<blockquote>
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets 
and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge
and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
